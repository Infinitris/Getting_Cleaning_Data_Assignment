# Code Book

## Summary

This code book contains information on the data, variables, any calculation done and the final output data.

## Source Data

Obtained from [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Files used in analysis:

* __activity_labels.txt__ -> Text file contains labels for each activity. There are a total of 6 activities.
* __features.txt__ -> All the measurement variable names
* __features_info.txt__ -> Information on the measurements done for each subject and activity
* __subject_train.txt__ -> The list of subject 
* __X_train.txt__ -> Main bulk of training measurement data
* __y_train.txt__ -> The list of activities by ID
* __subject_test.txt__ -> The list of subject 
* __X_test.txt__ -> Main bulk of training measurement data
* __y_test.txt__ -> The list of activities by ID

## How the script works

1. Checks for any missing packages used in script and install them if not available.
2. Loads the features, activities, training and test files.
3. Decodes the activities in `y_train` and `x_train` using `activities_labels`.
4. Merges the training data using `y_train`, `subject_train` and `x_train`.
5. `Features` are loaded into training data as variable names of the measurements.
6. Step 4 & 5 is done for test data using `y_test`, `subject_test` and `y_test` as well
7. Next the two combined training sets are merged together.
8. Here the script then extracts the relevant measurement columns that contains mean & standard deviation.
9. This final dataset is then group by the subject and activity, and the measurements are summarized as means.
10. The script then outputs a text file call `tiny_data.txt`

## Information on raw measurement variables

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals `tAcc-XYZ` and `tGyro-XYZ`. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (`tBodyAcc-XYZ` and `tGravityAcc-XYZ`) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (`tBodyAccJerk-XYZ` and `tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ`). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (`tBodyAccMag`, `tGravityAccMag`, `tBodyAccJerkMag`, `tBodyGyroMag`, `tBodyGyroJerkMag`). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing `fBodyAcc-XYZ`, `fBodyAccJerk-XYZ`, `fBodyGyro-XYZ`, `fBodyAccJerkMag`, `fBodyGyroMag`, `fBodyGyroJerkMag`. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
`'-XYZ'` is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

* tBodyAcc-XYZ
* tGravityAcc-XYZ
* tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* tBodyGyro-XYZ
* tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
* tBodyAccMag
* tGravityAccMag
* tBodyAccJerkMag
* tBodyGyroMag
* tBodyGyroJerkMag
* fBodyAcc-XYZ
* fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
* fBodyGyro-XYZ
* fBodyAccMag
* fBodyAccJerkMag
* fBodyGyroMag
* fBodyGyroJerkMag


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are (bold are used in this analysis): 

* __mean(): Mean value__
* __std(): Standard deviation__
* mad(): Median absolute deviation 
* max(): Largest value in array
* min(): Smallest value in array
* sma(): Signal magnitude area
* energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
* iqr(): Interquartile range 
* entropy(): Signal entropy
* arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
* correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
* maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
* meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
* skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
* kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
* bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
* angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

* gravityMean
* tBodyAccMean
* tBodyAccJerkMean
* tBodyGyroMean
* tBodyGyroJerkMean
